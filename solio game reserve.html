</div>

<p class="story">
          The Solio Game Reserve was established in 1973 as a private reserve for the breeding of black rhinos. The Reserve is located in the Laikipia region of Kenya, about two hours north of Nairobi. It was one of the first private rhino sanctuaries in Africa, and it has been hugely successful in increasing the population of black rhinos.    
  </p>

  <p class="storyline">
          In addition to rhinos, the reserve is also home to over 400 bird species, including the secretary bird, the African fish eagle, and the black-winged kite. The reserve also has a large population of zebras, giraffes, and warthogs.    
  <p class="storyline">
          The reserve is known for its stunning scenery and abundant wildlife, including rhinos, elephants, lions, and giraffes. There are also many rare and endangered species in the reserve, including the Grevy's zebra and the Jackson's hartebeest.   
        </p>
        <p class="storyline">
          One of the best things about the Solio Game Reserve is that it offers visitors the opportunity to get up close and personal with the wildlife. There are several hides located throughout the reserve, where you can watch the animals without disturbing them.

</p>
 

<h3 class="topic"> Altitude Sickness</h3>

          <p class="storyline"> 
                    While the wildlife in the Solio Game Reserve is generally harmless, it's important to be aware of the potential for animal bites. If you're bitten by an animal, make sure to clean the wound thoroughly and seek medical attention as soon as possible.  
                    </p>
                    <p class="storyline">

<h3 class="sub-head">Cultural etiquettes at Solio Game Reserve</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  The Solio Game Reserve is located in central Kenya, and is home to a diverse range of cultures. When visiting the reserve, it is important to be aware of the local customs and traditions. First, it is important to dress modestly, as revealing clothing may be seen as disrespectful. 
</p>  
<p class="storyline">
  Additionally, it is important to greet people with a handshake and to make eye contact when speaking to them. It is also important to be respectful of the local wildlife, and to avoid disturbing them in any way. Lastly, it is important to always ask permission before taking photos of people or their property.
</p> 
<p class="storyline">
  In addition to the above, there are a few more cultural etiquettes that visitors should be aware of when visiting the Solio Game Reserve. First, it is important to avoid pointing with your index finger, as this is considered rude. Instead, use your entire hand when pointing. 
</p> 
<p class="storyline">
  Second, it is important to be aware of the different gestures that are used in the area. For example, the "thumbs up" gesture is often used to express approval, while the "thumbs down" gesture is used to express disapproval. 
</p>  
<p class="storyline">
  Lastly, it is important to be mindful of the local time. In Kenya, time is often referred to in relation to meals, rather than in relation to the clock. For example, people might say "in the morning" instead of "at 9am." 
</p>  
<p class="storyline">
  By being aware of these cultural customs, visitors can ensure that their trip to the Solio Game Reserve is a positive and respectful experience.

  The park also has a radio station, Radio Solio, which broadcasts in both English and Swahili. This helps to keep visitors and staff up-to-date on important information and events.
</p>  


<h3 class="sub-head">Vital Information on Money Matters</h3>
<p class="storyline">

</p>
<p class="storyline">
