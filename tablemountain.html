<p class="story">
  Table Mountain is a flat-topped mountain located in Cape Town, South Africa. It is one of the most iconic landmarks in the country and a popular tourist attraction. The mountain gets its name from its distinctive flat summit, which resembles a table. Table Mountain is part of the Table Mountain National Park and offers stunning views of Cape Town and the surrounding area.  
</p>
 <p class="storyline">
  The mountain is approximately 1,085 meters (3,558 feet) high and is made up of layers of sandstone and granite. It is home to a diverse range of flora and fauna, including several endemic plant species. Table Mountain is also a popular destination for hikers and rock climbers, with numerous trails and climbing routes to explore.
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  One of the best ways to experience Table Mountain is by taking the cableway to the summit, where visitors can enjoy panoramic views of Cape Town, Robben Island, and the Atlantic Ocean. The mountain is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and plays a significant role in shaping the landscape and culture of Cape Town.

<h3 class="head">Things to know before travelling to Table mountain </h3>
<p class="story">
This article is a tip of the iceberg but will equip you with the "Absolute Need to Knows" for Table mountain.</p>
<div id="sample">
<h3 class="sub-head">How to get there?</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  Getting to Table Mountain in South Africa is fairly simple. The mountain is located in Cape Town, which is served by Cape Town International Airport. Once you arrive in Cape Town, you can take a taxi or a shuttle bus to the base of the mountain. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  There are also a number of guided tours that can take you to the top of the mountain. Once you're at the base of the mountain, there are a few different ways to reach the summit. You can take the cable car, which is the easiest option, or you can hike up one of the trails. 
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">About the weather</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  The weather at Table Mountain is quite varied and can change rapidly. The mountain is known for its "tablecloth," which is a cloud that often covers the top of the mountain. This cloud can appear and disappear quickly, and it can also bring rain and wind.  
</p>

<p class="storyline">
  In general, the weather at Table Mountain is best in the summer months, from November to March. During this time, the temperatures are warm and the skies are generally clear. However, it's important to be prepared for anything, as the weather can change at any time. 
</p>


<h3 class="sub-head">Medical matters that affect your visit</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  There are several medical matters that can affect your visit to Table Mountain in South Africa. Here are some of the key considerations:
</p>

<h3 class="topic">  Altitude Sickness</h3>
<p class="storyline">
Table Mountain stands at an elevation of about 1,085 meters (3,560 feet) above sea level. Some visitors may experience symptoms of altitude sickness, such as headaches, nausea, and shortness of breath, especially if they ascend quickly to the summit. It is important to acclimatize gradually and stay hydrated to reduce the risk of altitude-related issues.
</p>
<h3 class="topic">  Sunburn and UV Exposure</h3>
<p class="storyline">
 South Africa has a high UV index, especially at higher altitudes. Visitors should take precautions to protect their skin from sunburn by wearing sunscreen, hats, and sunglasses. It is also important to stay hydrated and seek shade during peak sun hours.
</p>
<h3 class="topic">  Physical Fitness</h3>
<p class="storyline">
Exploring Table Mountain often involves hiking or climbing, which can be physically demanding. Visitors should be in good physical condition and prepared for strenuous activities to avoid injuries or exhaustion.
</p>
<h3 class="topic">  Dehydration</h3>
<p class="storyline">
The climate in South Africa can be dry, especially during the summer months. Visitors should drink plenty of water to stay hydrated, especially when engaging in physical activities.
</p>
<h3 class="topic">  Wildlife Encounters</h3>
<p class="storyline">
 While the risk is low, visitors to Table Mountain should be aware of the potential for encounters with wildlife, such as snakes or insects. It is important to stay alert, follow park guidelines, and know how to respond in case of an encounter.
</p>
<h3 class="topic">  Pre-existing Medical Conditions</h3>
<p class="storyline">
 Visitors with pre-existing medical conditions, such as asthma, heart problems, or allergies, should take extra precautions and carry necessary medications with them. It is advisable to consult a healthcare provider before visiting Table Mountain if you have any concerns.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
  Before visiting Table Mountain, it is recommended to research and prepare for any potential medical matters that may arise during your trip. 
 </p>
  <p class="storyline">
  It is always a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider or travel medicine specialist for personalized advice based on your individual health needs. 
</p>


<h3 class="sub-head">Safety at Table Mountain</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  While Table Mountain is generally safe, there are a few things to keep in mind to stay safe. First, it's important to be aware of your surroundings and to avoid going off the beaten path. There have been reports of muggings and robberies on the mountain, so it's best to stay on the main trails and to avoid going alone.    
</p>

<p class="storyline">
  It's also important to be aware of the wildlife on the mountain, including baboons and snakes. Baboons can be aggressive, and snakes can be dangerous. If you see either, do not approach them and instead head in the opposite direction. 
</p>


<h3 class="sub-head">The water is drinkable</h3>
<p class="storyline">
Although at many restaurants you will be asked whether you'd like to kick off with still or sparkling, the Cape Town water is perfectly safe to drink. If you leave the city to visit smaller towns, ask the locals if they drink the water, although generally water in the Western Cape is perfectly drinkable.
</p>


<h3 class="sub-head">Hide your food around baboons</h3>

<p class="storyline">
Baboons are a part of life in Cape Peninsula. Most visitors will give these large-toothed primates a wide berth. But for others, the intrigue of seeing a monkey hang out on a beach or wander through a car park is too great. 

</p>

<p class="storyline">
Feeding the baboons is strictly prohibited. They will happily leap into an open car of an unsuspecting tourist to whip a picnic out of their hand. Or they will riffle through unattended bags on the Cape point beaches, whilst the owners look on dumfounded from the ocean. If you see baboons around, roll up the windows and stash the snacks.   
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Remember: Table mountain is still a mountain</h3>

<p class="storyline">Visible from pretty much every corner of the city, Cape Town's flat-topped mountain is the emblem and pride of South African capital. It's also a must see. Don't let it's proximity to the center fool you. Even on a sunny day the weather at the top is often cool and windy, so don't head up in your beach gear with no layers to add.</p>

<p class="storyline">
If you are hiking rather than taking the cable car, adopt the usual rules: don't go alone, always tell people where you're headed, stick to the marked trails, pre-plan your route. Every year there are tales of travelers who get lost on the mountain and have to rely on local search and rescue services to bring them back down.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
  Take local advise on which route to tackle. Some are safe while others should only be attempted with larger groups or in the company of a seasoned guide.
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Don't forget to tip</h3>

<p class="storyline">Although expected amounts are not on a par with those in North America, South Africa has a tipping culture and many workers will expect you to add a little something onto the bill. In reastuarants and bars, 10% is acceptable, though 12-15% is better. </p>

<p class="storyline">
  Give R5-10 to petrol pump attendants (you can't pump your own gas in South Africa) and R5-10 to informal parking guards, depending on the level of service they offer (some barely glance at your car, others will help you squeeze in and out of tight spaces). 
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Vital information on money matters</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  There are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to money matters at Table Mountain. First, the currency in South Africa is the South African Rand. There are ATMs available at the bottom of the mountain, and many businesses on the mountain accept credit cards. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  However, it's always a good idea to have some cash on hand, especially if you plan to buy food or souvenirs. Additionally, keep in mind that there is an entrance fee to the Table Mountain National Park. The fee is around $10 for adults and $5 for children. 
</p>

<h3 class="topic">  Cable Car Ride</h3>
<p class="storyline">
If you prefer a more relaxed way to enjoy the views, you can take a ride on the Table Mountain Aerial Cableway. The rotating cable car offers panoramic views of Cape Town and the Atlantic seaboard as it ascends to the mountaintop.
</p>
<h3 class="topic">  Abseiling</h3>

</p>
<p class="storyline">
