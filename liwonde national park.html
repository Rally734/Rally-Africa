          Liwonde National Park is a stunning and diverse landscape. The park is made up of a mixture of savannah, marshes, and woodlands, which are home to a wide variety of wildlife. The park is also home to the Shire River, which is a major tributary of the Zambezi River.   
  </p>

  <p class="storyline">
          The river flows through the park, and is a popular spot for hippos, crocodiles, and fish eagles. The river is also home to many different species of fish, including tigerfish and catfish.   
  <p class="storyline">
          Another thing that sets Liwonde National Park apart from other national parks is its history. The park was originally established as a hunting reserve in the early 1900s, and was used as a royal hunting ground for the King of England.  
        </p>
        <p class="storyline">
          Later, it was designated as a protected area and opened to the public. Today, the park is managed by the Malawian government and is a popular destination for tourists from all over the world.  
    </p>
    <p class="storyline">
          In addition to its wildlife and history, Liwonde National Park is also known for its stunning views. The park is surrounded by the Rift Valley, which gives the landscape a dramatic and rugged appearance.     
</p>
</p>

<p class="story">
This article is a tip of the iceberg but will equip you with the "Absolute Need to Knows" for Liwonde National Park.</p>
<div id="sample">
<h3 class="sub-head">How to get there?</h3>
<p class="storyline">
          Liwonde National Park is located about 100 miles south of the capital city of Lilongwe. The best way to get there is by car or bus. 
        </p>
          <p class="storyline">
          
          If you're coming from outside of Malawi, you'll need to fly into either the Kamuzu International Airport in Lilongwe or Chileka International Airport in Blantyre. From there, you can rent a car or take public transportation to the park.   
  </p>
  <p class="storyline">
          If you're renting a car, the drive from Lilongwe to Liwonde National Park will take about 3 hours. The drive from Blantyre will take about 2.5 hours. From Lilongwe, you can take the M1 road south to the town of Balaka. From there, you'll need to take a left turn onto the M8 road, which will take you directly to the park.     
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          If you're coming from Blantyre, you can take the M1 road north to Balaka and then follow the same directions. Keep in mind that the roads in Malawi can be rough, so a four-wheel-drive vehicle is recommended.          
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          Public transportation is also available, but it's less reliable and can be crowded. There are buses that run from Lilongwe and Blantyre to Balaka, and then you can take a minibus from Balaka to the park.
