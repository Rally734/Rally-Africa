<h3 class="sub-head">Is it safe around the Gorillas?</h3>
<p class="storyline">
Mountain Gorillas in Uganda are not considered dangerous as long as everything is peaceful and relaxed. The large male mountain gorillas or silverbacks are generally gentle and shy by nature. The gorilla groups have become habitual of the human presence amidst them. However there are certain set of rules that needs to be followed without fail, for the sake of your and your group's safety. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
Here are some of the rules for gorilla trekking:
<br><br>
. A minimum distance of 6-10 ft needs to be kept between you and the primates.
<br><br>
. A mask is mandatory if you have come from a high risk Covid country.
<br><br>
. If the silverbacks approaches or charge at you aggressively, you need to stay calm. Do not think of running away, rather go into a submissive position and do not lock eyes with the giant male. 
<br><br>
.Do not make sudden moves or loud noises.
<br><br>
.Locking eyes with the apes are seen as an act of hostility and can cause the ape to go berserk.
<br><br>
.No smoking, drinking or eating is allowed wihin a vicinity of 200 meters of a gorilla troop. 
<br><br>
.Children below the age of 15 are not allowed to participate in the trek.
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Are taking pictures allowed?</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  Taking  pictures around the gorillas is allowed, but keep in mind that the flash of your camera or phone is off. The sudden burst of light might agitate and scare the group, resulting the alpha male breaking into a fit of rage.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
 The reason being is that the silverback is the protector of the gorilla family and would treat any form of sudden threat with extreme hostility. Also make sure to carry a waterproof bag for your camera, to protect the camera from the rains.
</p>
<p class="storyline">

</p>



<h3 class="sub-head">How to get your permits?</h3>

</p>

<p class="storyline">
   Trekking to the spot where the gorillas put up often requires athletic levels of fitness. Mountain gorilla tours require you 
to be in your physical state as you can never be sure which group you get paired along with.
