<h3 class="sub-head">Medical Matters That Affect Your Visit</h3>
<p class="storyline">
          Here are some more medical matters to keep in mind when visiting the Cape Winelands:    
</p>
<p class="storyline">
          The area is known for its high levels of pollen, so if you have allergies, make sure to bring antihistamines. 
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          The risk of tick-borne diseases is quite high, so if you get bitten by a tick, seek medical attention immediately.      
</p>
<p class="storyline">
          Snake bites are also a possibility, so make sure to wear proper footwear and always be aware of your surroundings.
</p>
<p class="storyline">
          Finally, the Cape Winelands are also home to the Cape cobra, which is the most venomous snake in Africa. Be extra careful when  exploring the area, and if you see a cobra, move away slowly and calmly. Remember that they are more afraid of you than you are of them.     
</p>
<p class="storyline">
          By taking these precautions, you can enjoy a safe and healthy visit to the Cape Winelands. And don't forget to enjoy the stunning views, amazing wine, and delicious food while you're there. 
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Drink Responsibly</h3>

<p class="storyline">
          Drinking responsibly and being aware of local laws is crucial when visiting the Cape Winelands. First, the legal drinking age in South Africa is 18, so you must be over 18 to consume alcohol. Second, the legal blood alcohol content (BAC) limit for driving is 0.05%.   
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          Driving under the influence of alcohol is illegal and can result in serious penalties, including jail time. Third, it's important to be aware of your surroundings when drinking, and never leave your drink unattended. Finally, it's best to avoid drinking and driving altogether - there are plenty of taxis and shuttle services available in the area. 
</p>


<p class="storyline">
          So have fun but do so responsibly! The wineries are known for their quality wines and it's easy to get carried away. The last thing you want is to end your trip to the Cape Winelands with a DUI(Driving Under Influence).  
</p>
<p class="storyline">
          Instead, relax, enjoy the wine tastings, and leave the driving to someone else. Cheers - or rather, "Gesondheid!" (which means "to your health" in Afrikaans). 
</p>
