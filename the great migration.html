<p class="story">
 The Great Migration in Tanzania is an annual event in which millions of Wildebeests and Zebras migrate from the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania to the Masai Mara National Reserve in Kenya. The migration typically starts in May, when the animals head north in search of fresh grazing lands. In July, the animals reach the Grumeti River, where they must cross the crocodile-infested
 waters to continue their journey.
  <p class="storyline">
  As the animals continue their journey north, they eventually reach the Mara River, which they must also cross. This river crossing is considered the most dangerous part of the migration, as the animals must swim through strong currents and dodge crocodiles in order to make it to the other side.  
</p>
</p>
<p class="storyline">
In October, the animals reach the Masai Mara, where they spend the dry season grazing on the grasslands. In November, the animals begin their return journey south to the Serengeti. Overall, the Great Migration is an incredible spectacle of nature that is truly a sight to behold.

<p class="story">
This article is a tip of the iceberg but will equip you with the "Absolute Need to Knows" for The Great Migration.</p>
<div id="sample">
<h3 class="sub-head">How to get there?</h3>
<p class="storyline">
The best way to get into the Great Migration is by flying into the Kilimanjaro International Airport,which is located near Arusha. From there, it's a 4-5 hour drive to the Serengeti National Park. Alternatively, you can fly directly to the Serengeti via a light aircraft. There are several airstrips in the Serengeti that are used for the safari flights.  
</p>
<p class="storyline">
Once you're in the Serengeti, you'll need to take a safari vehicle to get to the migration. It's best to book a safari tour in advance, as the roads can be difficult to navigate without a guide.
</p>
<h3 class="sub-head">About the weather</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  The weather in the Serengeti during the Great Migration is typically dry and warm, with daytime temperatures ranging from 25-30 degrees Celsius (77-86 degrees Fahrenheit). It's important to pack clothing that is lightweight and breathable. The nights can be quite cool, so it's a good idea to bring a light jacket or sweater for the evenings. 
  </p>
  <p class="storyline">

</p>

<h3 class="topic">Malaria</h3>

</p>

<h3 class="topic">  Traveler's diarrhea</h3>
<p class="storyline">
Changes in diet and exposure to unfamiliar bacteria can increase the risk of traveler's diarrhea. It is essential to practice good hygiene, such as washing hands regularly, drinking bottled or boiled water, and avoiding consuming raw or undercooked foods. 
</p>

<h3 class="topic">  Sun exposure</h3>
<p class="storyline">
The sun in Tanzania can be intense, so it is crucial to protect yourself from sunburn by using sunscreen, wearing protective clothing, and seeking shade during peak hours. 
</p>

<h3 class="topic">  Altitude sickness</h3>
<p class="storyline">
 Parts of Tanzania, such as the Ngorongoro Crater, are at high altitudes, which can lead to altitude sickness in some individuals. It is important to acclimatize slowly, stay hydrated, and consider medication if necessary. 
</p>

<h3 class="topic">  Wildlife encounters</h3>
<p class="storyline">
 The Great Migration offers a unique opportunity to see wildlife up close, but it also comes with some risks. It is essential to follow park regulations, maintain a safe distance from animals, and be aware of the potential for insect bites or stings.
</p>

<h3 class="topic">  Medical facilities</h3>
<p class="storyline">
 While Tanzania has some good medical facilities in major cities, remote areas may have limited access to healthcare services. Travelers should consider purchasing travel insurance that includes medical evacuation coverage in case of emergencies.

  It is essential to consult with a healthcare provider or travel medicine specialist well in advance of your trip to the Great Migration in Tanzania to discuss any specific medical concerns, receive personalized recommendations, and ensure a safe and healthy journey.
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Cultural etiquettes at The Great Migration</h3>
<p class="storyline">

When visiting the Serengeti National Park, dress modestly and avoid wearing bright colors. It is also important to avoid taking photos of the Maasai people without their permission. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
