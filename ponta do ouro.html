</p>


<h3 class="sub-head">What time of the year is best to visit?</h3>

<p class="storyline">
  The dry season is generally the best time to visit, with warm, sunny days and cooler evenings. The dry season is also a great time to spot wildlife in the Partial Marine Reserve, as the lack of rain concentrates animals around watering holes.
        </p>

<p class="storyline">
  The warm, sunny days of the dry season are perfect for beach activities such as swimming, snorkeling, and sunbathing. The sea is generally calmer during this time, making it easier to enjoy the water.
        </p>

<p class="storyline">
  If you're interested in whale watching, the best time to visit is during the whale migration season from July to October. For kitesurfing enthusiasts, the windy conditions of Ponta do Ouro are ideal during the dry season, with the months of August to December being the peak season.
        </p>

<p class="storyline">
  The dry season is also peak tourist season in Ponta do Ouro, so you may encounter more crowds during this time. However, if you're looking for a quieter experience, consider visiting during the shoulder seasons of April-May or September-October. Accommodation and tour prices can be higher during peak season, so if you're on a budget, consider visiting during the low or shoulder seasons when prices are more affordable.
        </p>

<p class="storyline">
  If you're interested in experiencing local culture and festivals, the wet season is a good time to visit as there are several events and celebrations taking place during this time. Due to the popularity of Ponta do Ouro during the peak season, it's recommended to book your accommodation and any activities or tours well in advance to secure your preferred options.
