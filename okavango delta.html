<p class="story">
          The Okavango Delta is a vast inland river delta in northern Botswana. It is formed where the Okavango River flows into the Kalahari Desert, creating a unique ecosystem of marshes, channels, lagoons, and islands. The delta is fed by seasonal rains in the Angola highlands, which flow more than a thousand kilometers to reach the delta, making it one of the largest inland deltas in the world.    
  <p class="storyline">
          The Okavango Delta is home to a diverse array of wildlife, including elephants, hippos, crocodiles, lions, leopards, and a wide variety of bird species. It is a popular destination for safari-goers and nature enthusiasts, offering opportunities for game drives, mokoro (traditional dugout canoe) excursions, walking safaris, and birdwatching.
</p>
</p>
<p class="storyline">
          The delta is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognized for its ecological importance and exceptional natural beauty. It provides vital water sources for wildlife and local communities, and plays a crucial role in maintaining the region's biodiversity. The Okavango Delta is a must-visit destination for those seeking a unique and unforgettable safari experience in Africa.

<h3 class="head">Things to know before travelling to Okavango Delta</h3>
<p class="story">
This article is a tip of the iceberg but will equip you with the "Absolute Need to Knows" for Okavango Delta.</p>
<div id="sample">
<h3 class="sub-head">How to get there?</h3>
<p class="storyline">
The easiest and most popular way to get to Okavango Delta is by air. You can fly to one of the major cities in Africa such as Johannesburg, Nairobi, or Addis Ababa and then book a connecting flight to Maun, Botswana. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">       
Maun is the main gateway to the Okavango Delta and is well-connected to other parts of Africa.

<h3 class="sub-head">About the weather</h3>
<p class="storyline">
          The Okavango Delta has a subtropical climate, with two main seasons:  
</p>
<p class="storyline">
          Wet Season (November to March) is the hottest and wettest time of year, with temperatures averaging around 30째C (86째F) and heavy rain. The delta fills with water during this time, making it an ideal time for boat safaris and game viewing.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          Dry Season (April to October) is the cooler, drier time of year, with temperatures averaging around 25째C (77째F) and little to no rainfall. During the dry season, the Okavango Delta becomes a paradise for wildlife. 
          </p>
          <p class="storyline">
          As the water levels begin to drop, animals congregate around the remaining water sources, making it an excellent time for game viewing. The dry season is also a great time for birdwatching, as migratory birds flock to the delta in search of food and water.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          The dry season also offers an opportunity to explore the delta on foot, as the bush becomes less dense and easier to navigate. This allows visitors to experience the Okavango Delta in a more intimate and immersive way. 
</p>

          The Okavango Delta is home to the Bayei, the Hambukushu, and the Batawana, who have lived in the region for centuries. These groups are known for their rich cultural traditions, which are closely tied to the delta's natural environment. The Bayei and Hambukushu people speak the Okavango Delta's unique Kavango languages, which are not related to the Bantu languages that are predominant in the region.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          The Bayei people have traditionally fished the Okavango Delta using a unique style of fishing called "molapula." This involves wading into the water and driving fish into traps, using a fan-shaped structure called a "murembo."
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Cultural Ettiquettes at Okavango Delta</h3>

<p class="storyline">
          Here are a few cultural etiquette tips to keep in mind when visiting the Okavango Delta:
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          When visiting local villages or interacting with the indigenous people, it's important to dress conservatively. Women should wear clothes that cover their shoulders and knees, while men should avoid wearing shorts or singlets.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          If you're invited to someone's home, it's polite to bring a small gift, such as some sweets or a small bottle of whiskey. However, avoid giving money as it can be seen as disrespectful. The local people are very friendly and welcoming. It's important to greet them with a warm smile and a friendly handshake, especially if you're meeting someone for the first time. You can also try saying "Dumela," which means "hello" in Setswana.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          Always ask permission before taking someone's photo. Some people may not want their photo taken or may request payment. Remember to treat everyone with respect and kindness. The Okavango Delta is a unique and sensitive ecosystem. When visiting the Okavango Delta, it's important to take care of the environment and respect local customs. For example:
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          - Avoid littering or polluting the water.
          <br><br>
          - Don't approach or feed the wildlife.
          <br><br>
          - Stay on designated paths to avoid disturbing the ecosystem.
          
       
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          Remember, the Okavango Delta is a fragile ecosystem and it's up to all visitors to help protect it for future generations to enjoy. 
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Language and communication at Okavango Delta</h3>

<p class="storyline">
          The Okavango Delta is a multicultural region, with a variety of languages spoken. The dominant languages in the region are Setswana, Ikalanga, and Hambukushu. While most people speak English, knowing a few words in the local language can go a long way in building relationships with locals.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          Most lodges and guides in the Okavango Delta use sign language when communicating with each other and guests during game drives. This helps to maintain a quiet environment, which is important for observing wildlife without disturbing them.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          If you're lucky enough to go on a birdwatching tour in the Okavango Delta, you may notice that your guide communicates with other guides using bird calls. Each guide has a unique bird call that identifies them, and they use this to let others know about the location of specific birds or animals.

</p>

<p class="storyline">
          Most high-end lodges accept credit cards (Visa and Mastercard are most commonly accepted), but it's always a good idea to carry some cash as well. There are very few ATMs in the Okavango Delta, so it's important to withdraw enough cash before you arrive. Maun, the gateway town to the Okavango Delta, is the best place to find ATMs.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          Tipping is not obligatory, but is appreciated in Botswana. A 10-15% tip for guides and waitstaff is the norm. If you're unsure, ask your tour operator or lodge for guidance.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          Many lodges have established community trusts that fund local initiatives. These community trusts often welcome donations, and some lodges even have donation boxes where guests can make contributions. This is a great way to support the local communities that play a crucial role in maintaining the Okavango Delta's natural beauty and wildlife.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          Overall, managing your money in the Okavango Delta requires a bit of planning, but can be easily done with a little preparation. Just remember to be mindful of the local customs and practices, and don't be afraid to ask for guidance if you're unsure.

</p>

<p class="storyline">
          During the dry season (May to October), the water levels in the Delta are at their lowest, making it easier to see wildlife congregating around water sources. This is also when the weather is cooler and drier, making for more comfortable safari conditions.

          The flood season (December to March), fills the Delta with water from the Angolan highlands, creating a unique and spectacular landscape. The wildlife disperses more widely, but the birdlife is abundant, and the waterways are teeming with hippos, crocodiles, and other aquatic creatures.
