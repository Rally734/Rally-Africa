</p>

<p class="storyline">
          In addition to Malagasy, there are many local languages and dialects. The dialects can vary greatly, even from one village to the next.

</p>

<p class="storyline">
          Like anywhere else, there may be individuals looking to take advantage of tourists. Be cautious when approached by strangers and be aware of common scams. Your guide is your best resource for navigating the park safely and responsibly. Listen to their advice and follow their instructions at all times.
</p>


<h3 class="sub-head">Vital Information on Money Matters </h3>

</p>

<p class="storyline">
          Few businesses accept credit cards, and many charge a higher price for using them, so it's best to have cash on hand. If you do bring a credit card, make sure to notify your bank of your travel plans to avoid fraud blocks.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          Tipping is not required but appreciated in Madagascar. For guides and meals, a 10% tip is customary. Bargaining is common in Madagascar, especially in markets and souvenir shops. When haggling, be friendly and polite. Start at around 50% of the asking price and negotiate from there. If the seller is unyielding, it’s polite to thank them and move on.

<h3 class="sub-head">What time of the year is best to visit?</h3>

<p class="storyline">
          The best time to visit Tsingy de Bemaraha National Park varies depending on your priorities and interests. Here are some factors to consider. The most comfortable time to visit the park is during the cooler dry season, which runs from April to October. 
  </p>
<p class="storyline">
          July and August are generally the driest months, making them ideal for hiking and exploring the park's canyons and trails. The dry season is also the best time for wildlife viewing, as animals congregate around water sources and are easier to spot.  
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          The dry season is also the peak tourist season, meaning prices for accommodation and transportation are at their highest. However, visiting during the low season (November to March) can lead to significant savings. Just be aware that many parts of the park may be inaccessible during the rainy season due to flooding. 
          </p>
<p class="storyline">
          If you’re interested in experiencing local festivals or events, consider visiting during a major holiday or celebration. The Sakalava tribe celebrates the ‘Alahefa’ festival each year in July, which features traditional dances and rituals.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          If you prefer a quieter, more secluded experience, consider visiting during the shoulder seasons (April-May and September-October). The weather is still favorable for outdoor activities, and there will be fewer tourists in the park.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          During the wet season, some of the rock formations become slippery and dangerous, making activities like rock climbing and canyoning more challenging. If these activities are a priority for you, plan your visit during the dry season.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          Overall, the best time to visit Tsingy de Bemaraha depends on your personal preferences and travel goals.
