<h3 class="sub-head">Park fees and currency</h3>

<p class="storyline">
There are a few different park fees that apply to the Lower Zambezi National Park. The first is the park entry fee, which is 30 USD per person per day. This fee covers all activities in the park, such as game drives, walking safaris, and boat cruises. The second fee is the camping fee which 15 USD per person per day.  
</p>

<p class="storyline">
This fee applies to those who wish to camp in the park, and includes access to the ablution blocks and firewood. Both fees are paid in US dollars or Zambian Kwacha at the park gate.
</p>
<p class="storyline">
As for currency, the local currency is Zambian Kwacha, but US dollars are also widely accepted. You can also exchange your dollars or country currency at the banks or at the airport, and most businesses in the area accept both US dollars and Zambian Kwacha. 
</p>

<p class="storyline">
It's a good idea to bring some cash with you, as ATMs are not always reliable. Credit cards are generally not accepted in the park, so it's best to plan accordingly. 
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Vital information on money matters.</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  It is no secret that the cash crisis in Zimbabwe is critical. Victoria falls continues to flourish as a tourist destination, but there is very limited cash in Zimbabwe. 
</p>

<p class="storyline">
  It is crucial that you bring enough cash with you ( USD is the currency), because although almost everywhere now accepts credit cards, a few still don't. You will need cash for incidentials, park fees, tips and a reserve in case the card machine is not working, for things like visas.
  Pre book and pay for as much as you can prior to arrival.   
</p>

<p class="storyline">
  You may be able to get money out of an ATM machine in Zimbabwe but we do not recommend depending on the system as supplies may change overnight.
