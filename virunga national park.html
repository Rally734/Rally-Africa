<p class="story">
          The Virunga National Park was established in 1925, making it one of the oldest national parks in Africa. It covers an area of about 7,800 square kilometers, and it's surrounded by a variety of other protected areas, including <a href="queen elizabeth park.html"class="link"> Queen Elizabeth National Park</a> in Uganda and <a href="volcanoes park.html"class="link">  Volcanoes National Park </a> in Rwanda.   
  </p>
  <p class="storyline">
          The park is known for its stunning scenery, which includes the Virunga Mountains, Lake Kivu, and the Congo River. It's also known for its rich biodiversity, with more than 2,000 plant species and hundreds of animal species. The park is also home to Africa's most active volcano, Mount Nyiragongo.  
  <p class="storyline">
          One of the most interesting things about Nyiragongo is its lava lake. This lake is one of only a few that exist in the world, and it's constantly changing, with the lava levels rising and falling over time. Scientists have studied the lake extensively, and they've learned a lot about how volcanoes work as a result.  
    </p>
    <p class="storyline">
          There's also a large crater at the top of the volcano, which is over one kilometer wide. It's a pretty impressive sight to behold!
