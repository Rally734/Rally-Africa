  <h2 class="about">location: </h2> <h2 class="paragraph">Central Rift Valley, Kenya</h2>
</div>

<p class="story">
  Lake Nakuru National Park is located in the Great Rift Valley of Kenya, and it covers an area of about 188 square kilometers. The park was established in 1961, and it became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. 
  </p>

  <p class="storyline">
  The lake itself is a soda lake, and it's surrounded by acacia forest. The park is known for its wildlife, including flamingos, rhinos, and lions.
   There are also a number of hiking trails and camping areas within the park. 
  <p class="storyline">
        One of the most popular attractions at Lake Nakuru National Park is the flamingo colony. The lake is a major breeding ground for lesser flamingos, and the colony can sometimes number in the millions. The flamingos feed on the algae that grows in the lake, and their pink feathers are caused by the beta-carotene in their diet. 
        </p>
        <p class="storyline">
        Another popular attraction is the rhino sanctuary, which is home to both black and white rhinos. The park is also home to hippos, leopards, zebras, warthogs, gazelles, and giraffes. 
    There are also over 500 species of birds in the park, including fish eagles, marabou storks, and African fish owls.
    </p>
    <p class="storyline">
    Overall, Lake Nakuru National Park is a great place to visit for nature lovers and wildlife enthusiasts.

<p class="story">
This article is a tip of the iceberg but will equip you with the "Absolute Need to Knows" for Lake Nakuru National Park.</p>
<div id="sample">
<h3 class="sub-head">How to get there?</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  Lake Nakuru National Park is located about 175 kilometers (or 110 miles) northwest of Nairobi, the capital of Kenya. The most common way to get to the park is by road. If you're traveling from Nairobi, you can take the main highway towards Nakuru and then turn off onto the road leading to the park. 
  </p>
  <p class="storyline">
  It's also possible to take a bus or minibus from Nairobi to Nakuru, and then take a taxi or matatu (a minibus) to the park. Once you're in the park, there are several roads that lead to different parts of the park.
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  In addition to the roads, Lake Nakuru National Park also has a railway station, though it's not always in service. If you're traveling from further afield, the nearest airport is Jomo Kenyatta International Airport in Nairobi. From there, you can take a taxi or bus to Nakuru and then continue on to the park. 
  </p>
  <p class="storyline">
  It's also possible to take a flight to Eldoret International Airport, which is about 100 kilometers (or 60 miles) from Lake Nakuru National Park. Once you're at the park, you can explore it on foot, by bicycle, or by car. 
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">About the weather</h3>

The average daytime temperature is around 23 degrees Celsius (or 73 degrees Fahrenheit), while the average nighttime temperature is around 13 degrees Celsius (or 55 degrees Fahrenheit). The park is located in a semi-arid region, so it doesn't get much rainfall. 
  </p>

  <p class="storyline">
