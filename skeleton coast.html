    </p>      
          <p class="storyline">
The name "Skeleton Coast" originates from the whale and seal bones that used to litter the beaches from the whaling industry, as well as the skeletons of ships and sailors that met their demise in the harsh environment. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
          This barren and desolate region is characterized by its stark beauty, with vast sand dunes, rocky outcrops, and the cold Benguela Current of the Atlantic Ocean pounding the shore.

</p>
</p>
<p class="storyline">

<h3 class="head">Things to know before travelling to Skeleton Coast</h3>
<p class="story">
This article is a tip of the iceberg but will equip you with the "Absolute Need to Knows" for Skeleton Coast.</p>
<div id="sample">
<h3 class="sub-head">How to get there?</h3>
<p class="storyline">
          To visit Skeleton Coast, you can fly into the Hosea Kutako International Airport in Windhoek, the capital of Namibia. From there, you can take a domestic flight to Walvis Bay. From Walvis Bay, you can rent a car and drive to Skeleton Coast. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
          The drive will take you through the desert and provide you with stunning views of the landscape. Make sure to have a reliable GPS or map as the region is remote and can be challenging to navigate. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
          There are also regular bus services that run from Walvis Bay to the Skeleton Coast National Park. The main bus company that operates these routes is Intercape, and their buses depart from the Walvis Bay station in the city center.       
</p>
<p class="storyline">
          The journey takes about 3 hours, and you'll need to make sure to book in advance, as the buses can fill up quickly, especially during peak season. The bus is a great option if you're on a budget, and it's also a fun way to see the Namibian countryside!

</p>
<p class="storyline">
          In addition to the strong winds and high humidity, the area is also known for its fog.

          The Skeleton Coast is home to a variety of wildlife, but it's also a place where the forces of nature are particularly intense. The area is known for its sandstorms, which can happen suddenly and be extremely dangerous. Sandstorms can quickly reduce visibility, and the winds can be strong enough to blow over vehicles.            
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          Flash floods are also a common hazard in the area, and they can be especially dangerous when combined with the strong winds.

</p>


<h3 class="sub-head">About the locals</h3>


<p class="storyline">
          The locals who live near the Skeleton Coast are the Himba people, who have a unique culture and way of life. The Himba are known for their distinctive red ochre body paint, which they use to protect their skin from the harsh sun and to keep insects away. They are also known for their intricate jewelry and traditional dress.       
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          The Himba are semi-nomadic, and they often move around to find fresh water and grazing land for their cattle. They also have a strong connection to the land and their ancestors, and they believe that they must respect the spirits of the land in order to maintain balance
</p>
<p class="storyline">
          They are often photographed by tourists, but it's important to ask permission before taking photos, and to respect their privacy. It's also important to remember that the Skeleton Coast is a sacred place for the Himba, and it's not appropriate to take any natural objects from the area.
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Language and communication at Skeleton Coast</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  The Skeleton Coast, in Namibia, is home to a diverse array of languages and dialects. The predominant language spoken on the coast is Oshiwambo, but other languages such as Damara, Herero, and Nama are also spoken. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  English is also widely spoken, and is the official language of Namibia. Because of the region's history of contact with a wide variety of cultures, there is also a significant degree of linguistic variation and complexity. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  Many people are multilingual, and it is not uncommon for people to switch between languages in the course of a single conversation. Additionally, there is a strong influence of nonverbal communication, as hand gestures, facial expressions, and body language play an important role in daily life. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">

<h3 class="sub-head">Vital information on money matters</h3>

</p>

<p class="storyline">
          Credit cards are accepted in most places, but it's a good idea to have some cash on hand as well. The nearest ATMs are in the town of Swakopmund, so it's a good idea to withdraw money before heading to the Skeleton Coast. It's also a good idea to bring small bills, as change is often difficult to get.
</p>
<p class="storyline">
          Another important thing to know about money matters at the Skeleton Coast is that many of the local people are not used to bargaining. When shopping at local markets, it's best to pay the asking price, rather than trying to haggle. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
          This is out of respect for the local culture and traditions. It's also a good idea to ask before taking any photos of the vendors or their wares. If you're interested in buying any traditional crafts, it's a good idea to support the local artisans by buying directly from them, rather than through a middleman.
