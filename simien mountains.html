  The Simien Mountains are a truly special place! The landscape is stunning, with rugged peaks, lush valleys, and a variety of flora and fauna. The park is a great place for hiking and camping, and there are a few different routes that visitors can take. One of the most popular is the four-day hike from Debark to Sankaber.    
  </p>

  <p class="storyline">
    The hike takes visitors through a variety of landscapes, including juniper forests and highland plateaus. Along the way, hikers can see gelada baboons and other wildlife. Have you heard of the "chess game of the gelada baboons"?   
  <p class="storyline">
    The "chess game of the gelada baboons" is a term used to describe the way that gelada baboons play with one another. When two gelada baboons meet, they often approach each other slowly and then start a sort of "dance" where they groom each other, jump around, and display their teeth. This behavior is thought to be a way for the baboons to assert their dominance and show their strength. But to human observers, it looks a lot like a game of chess!
        </p>
        <p class="storyline">
