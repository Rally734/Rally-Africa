<div id="sample">
<h3 class="sub-head">How to get there?</h3>
<p class="storyline">
          Kigali International Airport is the main international airport in Rwanda, with flights from several major cities in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East. Kigali is well-connected to its neighboring countries by road. If you're coming from Uganda, you can enter Rwanda through the Gatuna/Katuna border post, which is about a two-hour drive to Kigali. If you're arriving at Kigali International Airport, you'll find many taxi and shuttle services available to take you into the city. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">       
          Once you’re in Kigali, you can get around using public transportation like moto-taxis (commonly known as "motos"), buses, and taxis. Moto-taxis are a popular and inexpensive way to get around the city.
</p>



<h3 class="sub-head">About the weather</h3>
<p class="storyline">
          Kigali's climate is generally pleasant throughout the year, with two distinct seasons.

</p>
<p class="storyline">
          Kigali is situated at an elevation of about 1,500 meters (4,921 feet) above sea level, which helps to keep the temperatures cool and comfortable throughout the year. Although Kigali's weather is relatively moderate, the city can experience occasional extreme weather events, such as thunderstorms and hailstorms, particularly during the rainy season. Keep an eye on weather forecasts and follow any warnings from local authorities.
</p>




<h3 class="sub-head">Medical matters that affect your visit.</h3>

          Make sure you are up to date on routine vaccinations, including measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, varicella (chickenpox), polio, and the yearly flu shot.

</p>

<h3 class="topic">Malaria</h3>
<p class="storyline">

</p>

<h3 class="topic">   Altitude Sickness  </h3>

<p class="storyline">
        Kigali is located at a higher elevation than many other cities, so visitors may experience symptoms of altitude sickness, such as headaches, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Take it easy upon arrival and stay hydrated to help alleviate symptoms.
</p>

<h3 class="topic"> Medical Facilities </h3>

<p class="storyline">

</p>

<h3 class="topic">   Traveler's Diarrhea </h3>

<p class="storyline">
       Just like in many other destinations, traveler's diarrhea can be a concern in Kigali. Practice good hygiene, such as frequent handwashing, and avoid consuming tap water, ice, and street food to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal issues.
          </p>

<h3 class="topic">  HIV/AIDS </h3>

<h3 class="topic">    Sun Protection  </h3>

<p class="storyline">
        The sun in Rwanda can be quite strong, so make sure to wear sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat to protect your skin from sunburn and reduce the risk of skin cancer.
</p>

</p>



<h3 class="sub-head">Cultural Ettiquettes at Kigali</h3>

<p class="storyline">
          Rwandans are known for their politeness and courtesy. Greeting others is very important. "Mwaramutse" (hello) or "Muraho" (hello, how are you?) are common greetings. Shaking hands with both hands (or right hand plus left forearm) is also a common greeting. It's important to dress conservatively. Men typically wear long trousers, while women wear dresses or skirts that extend to at least knee length. It's considered disrespectful to wear shorts, especially in rural areas.
</p>
 <p class="storyline">
          it's also polite to eat with your right hand, as the left hand is considered dirty. Before and after eating, people typically wash their hands as a sign of cleanliness. It's considered disrespectful to take photos of people without permission, especially in rural areas. Always ask first and respect their wishes if they decline.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          Pointing at people with your index finger is considered rude, as is touching someone's head or pointing your feet at another person. Public displays of affection are not common in Rwanda, and it’s considered impolite to stand with your arms crossed.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          Rwanda is predominantly Christian, with around 60% of the population being Catholic. Be respectful of religious customs, such as removing hats in church. Rwandans are known for their hospitality, and it's common for visitors to be invited into people’s homes for a meal or a chat. If invited, always accept the invitation and remove your shoes before entering.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          If you're visiting someone's home, it's polite to bring a small gift, such as flowers, chocolate, or wine. However, avoid giving gifts that are overly expensive, as this can be seen as a form of bribery. Rwanda takes great pride in its natural environment, and there are strict penalties for littering or harming wildlife. Respect the environment by disposing of your trash properly, and be mindful of the impact of your actions on the local flora and fauna.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          Rwanda is a socially conservative country, and homosexuality is considered taboo. Public displays of affection between same-sex couples are illegal, and can lead to arrest.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          Overall, be respectful, patient, and open-minded when interacting with Rwandans, and you'll find them to be warm and welcoming hosts.
</p>



<h3 class="sub-head">Language and communication at Kigali</h3>

<p class="storyline">
          Kinyarwanda is the primary language in Rwanda, with over 90% of the population speaking it. It's a Bantu language, related to other languages in the region like Swahili and Kirundi. While Kinyarwanda is the primary language, Rwanda also has two official languages: French and English. 
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          French is widely used in business and government, while English is gaining popularity, especially among young people. Many people in Kigali speak at least some English, so you shouldn’t have much trouble communicating in the city.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          Rwandans tend to be reserved and maintain a certain level of formality in their body language. Eye contact is important, and gestures like crossing your arms or leaning back can be seen as disrespectful. They typically greet each other with a handshake, sometimes accompanied by a hug and a gentle pat on the back. It’s considered polite to use the phrase "Muraho" (hello) or "Mwaramutse" (hello, how are you?) when greeting someone.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          Rwandans are usually patient listeners and expect the same from others. Avoid interrupting or talking over people, and be sure to listen attentively when someone is speaking. Rwandans generally avoid sarcasm and irony, as these can be difficult to understand across language barriers. Instead, use straightforward language and humor that is positive and lighthearted.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          It's considered impolite to bring up sensitive topics like ethnicity, politics, or the genocide when talking to Rwandans. They enjoy discussing topics like the weather, sports, family, and food. Ask locals for their recommendations on where to eat and what to see, and they'll likely be happy to offer advice and share their experiences.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
          Rwandans often greet each other by saying "Amakuru" (What news?), to which the common response is "Ntabana" (Everything is fine). You can also respond by saying "Ntabana" or by asking "Amakuru yawe?" (How are you?).  Rwandans tend to speak slowly and deliberately, so be patient and give them time to express themselves fully. This is particularly true if you’re speaking to someone whose first language is not English.
</p>

          Tipping is not customary in Rwanda, but it's appreciated if you're satisfied with the service.
