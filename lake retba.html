<p class="story">
  Lake Retba, also known as Lac Rose is a shallow saltwater lake in Senegal that's famous for its pink color. The lake gets its color from a type of algae that produces a red pigment called beta-carotene. The lake is also known for its salt mining industry, and its salt is considered some of the purest in the world.   
  </p>

  <p class="storyline">
    Lake Retba is thought to have formed around 30,000 years ago when the coastline of Senegal receded due to sea level changes. The lake is located near the Atlantic Ocean and is separated from the ocean by a narrow strip of land called the Langue de Barbarie.   
  <p class="storyline">
    The lake's unique pink color has made it a popular tourist destination. In addition to its salt mining industry, the lake is also a popular destination for fishing and birdwatching.

<h3 class="head">Things to know before travelling to Lake Retba</h3>
<p class="story">
This article is a tip of the iceberg but will equip you with the "Absolute Need to Knows" for Lake Retba.</p>
<div id="sample">
<h3 class="sub-head">How to get there?</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  The best way to get to Lake Retba is to fly into Dakar, the capital of Senegal. From there, you can take a bus or taxi to the city of M'Bour, which is about 45 miles from Lake Retba. From M'Bour, you can take a ferry or pirogue (a traditional canoe) across the lake to the salt mines.   
  </p>
  <p class="storyline">
    Another option is to take a private tour from Dakar that will take you directly to the lake. If you're feeling adventurous, you can even rent a motorbike and drive to the lake yourself.  
</p>


<h3 class="sub-head">About the weather</h3>

<p class="storyline">
  Lake Retba is located in a remote part of southeastern Senegal, about 150 miles from the capital, Dakar. The nearest city, M'Bour, is about 30 miles away. There are no roads that lead directly to the lake, so the only way to reach it is by boat or plane.  
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  The nearest airport is in Dakar. Because of its remote location, Lake Retba is not a popular tourist destination, and it's possible to spend a day at the lake without seeing another tourist center.  
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Cultural etiquettes at Lake Retba</h3>
<p class="storyline">

By following these simple cultural etiquettes, visitors can ensure that they have a positive and respectful experience at Lake Retba. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">

</p>
<p class="storyline">
  There are also a number of smaller ethnic groups who speak their own languages, including Serer, Pulaar, and Diola. However, English is not widely spoken, so visitors may have a difficult time communicating in English.
