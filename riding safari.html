</div>

<p class="story">
          Riding safaris in Kenya are available in a variety of locations, but the Maasai Mara National Reserve is one of the most popular destinations. The Maasai Mara is known for it's spectacular scenery and diverse wildlife. The riding safaris here typically last for several days, during which time riders stay in tented camps.
          
  <p class="storyline">
  These camps are usually located close to wildlife hotspots, allowing fantastic views of animals like Lions, Rhinos, and cheetahs. Riders also have the opportunity to learn about the Maasai culture from their local guides.  
</p>
</p>
<p class="storyline">
 The Horses used on the safaris are usually African stock horses, which are well-suited to the terrain and climate. These horses are sure-footed, allowing for safe and enjoyable rides through the savannahs and hills of the Maasai Mara. The safaris typically involve riding for several hours each day, with opportunities to dismount and explore the area on foot. The tented camps used on the safaris are usually very comfortable, with delicious meals and hot showers available.

<h3 class="head">Things to know before travelling to Riding Safari</h3>
<p class="story">
This article is a tip of the iceberg but will equip you with the "Absolute Need to Knows" for Riding Safari.</p>
<div id="sample">
<h3 class="sub-head">How to get there?</h3>
<p class="storyline">
Getting to the Maasai Mara for a riding safari is relatively easy. The most common route is to fly into Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, and then take a connecting flight to the town of Keekorok, which is just outside the Maasai Mara National Reserve. From Keekorok, you can be picked by your safari company and transported to your camp. Alternatively, you can fly directly to the Maasai Mara National Reserve from Nairobi on a small charter plane.
</p>
<p class="storyline">
It's also possible to reach the Maasai Mara by road transport. However, this option can be time-consuming and potentially dangerous, as the roads are often in poor condition. The main road into the Maasai Mara is the B3, which runs from Nairobi to Keekorok.
</p>
<p class="storyline">
This road is paved for the first few hours, but then becomes an unpaved gravel road for the rest of the journey. If you choose to travel by road, make sure you're prepared for a long and bumpy journey. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
 It's also important to travel with a reputable company, as there have been reports of crime and banditry on the roads in Kenya. So if you choose to travel by road, make sure to take extra safety precautions and only travel with a trusted guide. 
 </p>
 <p class="storyline">
 The journey on road can take anywhere from 6 to 10 hours, so be prepared for a long trip. However, the scenery along the way is stunning, and you'll have the chance to see more of the country than you would by air.
</p>


<h3 class="sub-head">About the weather</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  The weather in the Maasai Mara can vary greatly depending on the time of the year you visit. The rainy season runs from April to May, and again from October to December. During these months, the weather is generally warm and humid, with heavy downpours in the afternoons. The dry season is from June to September, and from January to March. 
</p>

<p class="storyline">
  During the dry season, the days are usually hot and sunny, with cooler evenings. The average temperature in the Maasai Mara ranges from 60 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit(15 to 27 degrees Celsius) year-round. 
  </p>
  <p class="storyline">
  The nights can get quite cold, so it's a good idea to pack warm clothes for evening activities. The humidity in the Maasai Mara is something to be aware of, especially during the rainy season. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  Overall, the weather in the Maasai Mara is very pleasant, with warm days and cool nights. However, it's always best to be prepared for any type of weather as the climate can be unpredictable. And remember, no matter what the weather is like, the natural beauty of the Maasai Mara is always stunning.  
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Medical matters that affect your visit.</h3>

<p class="storyline">
While there are no specific health risks associated with visiting the Maasai Mara, there are a few medical matters to be aware of. The most common concern is malaria, which is transmitted by mosquito bites. Make sure to pack mosquito repellent and wear long-sleeved shirts and pants when you're outside.  
</p>

<p class="storyline">
  It is also important to consult with your doctor before your trip to make sure you're up to date on all your vaccinations. Additionally, it's a good idea to bring a first-aid kit with you, just in case. Finally, it's important to drink plenty of water and stay hydrated, as the heat and humidity in the Maasai Mara can be intense.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
  Overall, the Maasai Mara is a relatively safe destination, but it's always best to take precautions to stay healthy and safe during your visit. And remember, if you do get sick while you're there, don't hestitate to seek medical attention. There are several medical facilities in the Maasai Mara, and most are well equipped to handle any common illnesses or injuries.  
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">About the locals</h3>

<p class="storyline">
 The Maasai people are the traditional inhabitants of the region around the Maasai Mara, and they are known for their vibrant culture and way of life. If you have the opportunity to visit a Maasai village, there are few things to keep in mind.
</p>

<p class="storyline">First, always ask permission before taking photos or videos of the Maasai people or their homes. Second, respect their customs and traditions, including their dress and greetings. It's also important to be aware that the Maasai are a very proud people and may not appreciate being treated as "exotic" or "other". Instead, show interest in their culture and history, and treat them with the same respect you would any other person.</p>

<p class="storyline">
If you follow these simple rules, you'll be sure to have a positive experience visiting the Maasai Mara and interacting with the local people. And who knows, you may even come away with a new friend or two!
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Precautions on wildlife.</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  When visiting the Maasai Mara, it's important to follow some basic precautions to stay safe around the wildlife. First and foremost, never approach or feed any animals, no matter how tame they may seem. All animals in the park are wild and can be unpredictable. Also make sure to follow the instructions of your safari guide at all times, especially when on a game drive.  
</p>

<p class="storyline">
  If you're on walking safari, stay close to your guide and follow their instructions. And finally, it's a good idea to bring binoculars and a camera with a zoom lens to observe the wildlife from a safe distance.   
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Language and communication at Maasai Mara Riding Safari</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  Language and communication at the Maasai Mara Riding Safari is an interesting and unique experience. The safari guides and staff are fluent in both English and Swahili, and are able to provide instructions and information in both languages. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  Swahili is the most commonly spoken language in the area, and many of the local Maasai people are also able to speak it. For those who do not speak Swahili, the guides and staff are also able to communicate in basic English, making the safari accessible to all. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  The use of hand gestures and body language is also common, allowing for communication even when there is a language barrier between guests and staff. In addition, there are opportunities to learn and practice Swahili during the safari, making it a fun and interactive way to learn about the local language and culture. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  The Maasai Mara Riding Safari is an immersive experience that allows visitors to get up close and personal with the local people and culture, and provides a unique opportunity to experience life in the African bush. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  By communicating with the local people and guides in both English and Swahili, visitors can truly immerse themselves in the experience and make lasting memories and connections.
</p>


<h3 class="sub-head">Vital information on money matters at Maasai Mara Riding Safari</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  While the safari provides a wonderful way to experience the area, it is important to be aware of some vital information regarding money matters. The safari is not cheap, and prices for the experience can range from $2,000 to $5,000 per person. In addition, it is important to note that all of the costs for the safari must be paid in US dollars. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  This means that visitors should be sure to bring enough cash to cover the costs of the safari, as well as any additional expenses they may incur during their stay. Furthermore, the Maasai Mara Riding Safari does not accept credit cards, so travelers should be prepared to pay for all expenses in cash. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  With these considerations in mind, the Maasai Mara Riding Safari can be a once-in-a-lifetime experience for those who are prepared to pay for the privilege. In addition to the monetary costs, the safari also requires a certain level of physical fitness, as guests will be spending long days in the saddle. However, the memories and experiences gained from the safari are sure to last a lifetime.
