          Volcanoes National Park, also known as Parc National des Volcans, is a national park in Rwanda that's best known for its population of mountain gorillas. The park is located in the Virunga Mountains, and it's home to five of the eight volcanoes in the Virunga Massif, including Mount Karisimbi, Mount Bisoke, and Mount Sabyinyo.  
  </p>
  <p class="storyline">

          One of the main draws of Volcanoes National Park is the opportunity to see mountain gorillas up close.  
  <p class="storyline">
          The park is home to around 300 mountain gorillas, and visitors can take part in gorilla trekking tours. These tours allow you to spend an hour observing a family of gorillas in their natural habitat.

<p class="story">
This article is a tip of the iceberg but will equip you with the "Absolute Need to Knows" for Volcanoes National Park.</p>
<div id="sample">
<h3 class="sub-head">How to get there?</h3>
<p class="storyline">
          There are a few ways to get to Volcanoes National Park. The most common way is to fly into Kigali International Airport in Rwanda, and then take a bus or taxi to the park. The drive from Kigali to the park is about three hours.

</p>


<h3 class="sub-head">About the weather</h3>
<p class="storyline">
          The weather in Volcanoes National Park is quite variable. The park is located at a high elevation, so the weather can be quite cool and wet. The average temperature is around 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius), and the park receives a lot of rainfall, especially during the rainy season from March to May. However, the weather can change rapidly, so it's best to be prepared for anything.  
  </p>

  



<h3 class="sub-head">Medical matters that affect your visit.</h3>

  </p>

  <h3 class="topic">Yellow Fever</h3>
<p class="storyline">
          Although the risk of yellow fever is low in the park, it's still a good idea to get a yellow fever vaccination if you're visiting from a country where the disease is common. 
  </p>

  <h3 class="topic">Malaria</h3>

          Altitude sickness is a real concern when visiting Volcanoes National Park. The park is located at a high elevation, and the symptoms of altitude sickness can include headaches, dizziness, nausea, and shortness of breath. 
          </p>
          <p class="storyline">
          It's important to take it easy when you first arrive in the park, and give yourself time to acclimate to the altitude. If you start to experience symptoms of altitude sickness, it's best to rest and drink plenty of fluids. If symptoms persist, it's important to seek medical attention. 
</p>

<h3 class="topic">Other Diseases</h3>
