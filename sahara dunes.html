</div>
  <p class="story">
    The Sahara dunes in Morocco are a part of the vast Sahara Desert, which is the largest hot desert in the world, covering much of North Africa. The Sahara desert extends across several countries including Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, Egypt, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger. 
</p>

<p class="storyline">
  In Morocco, the Sahara desert is known for its stunning sand dunes, which are some of the most iconic and recognizable features of the desert landscape. The Erg Chebbi and Erg Chigaga dunes are two of the most popular dune formations in Morocco.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
  Erg Chebbi, located near the town of Merzouga in southeastern Morocco, is known for its towering orange sand dunes that can reach heights of up to 150 meters. Visitors to Erg Chebbi can experience thrilling activities such as camel treks, sandboarding, and camping under the stars in traditional Berber desert camps.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
  Erg Chigaga is another impressive dune area located in the region of Zagora, further south than Erg Chebbi. These dunes are less visited and provide a more remote and tranquil desert experience for those looking to escape the crowds.
</p>

 <p class="storyline">
  Exploring the Sahara dunes in Morocco offers a unique and unforgettable experience, allowing visitors to witness the breathtaking beauty of the desert landscape and immerse themselves in the rich Berber culture and history of the region.

</p>
<p class="storyline">
    
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">About the weather</h3>

<p class="storyline">
The weather in the Sahara dunes can be extreme and unpredictable. The daytime temperature in the summer can reach over 100 degrees Fahrenheit(38 degrees Celsius), while the night time temperature can drop below freezing. In the winter, the daytime temperature can be milder, but the nights can be quite cold. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
The weather is also very dry, with very little rainfall throughout the year. It's important to be prepared for the extremes of temperature and to bring plenty of water and sun protection.
In addition, the wind can be strong and gusty, and sandstorms are common.
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Medical matters that affect your visit</h3>

<p class="storyline">
  Here are some medical matters that may affect your visit to the Sahara dunes:
</p>

<h3 class="topic">  Dehydration</h3>
<p class="storyline">
 The hot and arid climate of the Sahara desert can lead to rapid water loss through sweating and evaporation. It is important to stay well hydrated by drinking plenty of water before and during your visit to prevent dehydration.
</p>

<h3 class="topic">  Heatstroke</h3>
<p class="storyline">
The extreme temperatures in the Sahara desert can increase the risk of heatstroke, a condition that occurs when the body overheats and is unable to regulate its temperature. It is important to stay cool, seek shade, and avoid strenuous activity during the hottest parts of the day.       
</p>

<h3 class="topic">  Sunburn</h3>
<p class="storyline">
The intense sun exposure in the desert can lead to sunburn if adequate sun protection measures are not taken. It is essential to wear sunscreen with a high SPF, protective clothing, and sunglasses to prevent sunburn.    
</p>

<h3 class="topic">  Sandstorms</h3>
<p class="storyline">
 Windy conditions in the Sahara desert can cause sandstorms, which may lead to respiratory issues for some individuals. It is advisable to wear a face mask or scarf to protect your airways during sandstorms.    
</p>

<h3 class="topic">  Insect bites</h3>
<p class="storyline">
The desert environment is home to various insects, including mosquitoes and flies, which can transmit diseases such as malaria and dengue fever. It is essential to use insect repellent and wear long-sleeved clothing to prevent insect bites.
</p>

<h3 class="topic">  Allergies</h3>
<p class="storyline">
 Some individuals may be sensitive to desert plants, pollen, or dust, leading to allergic reactions such as hay fever or asthma. It is important to bring necessary medications and consult a healthcare provider before your visit.      
</p>

<h3 class="topic">  Physical fitness</h3>
<p class="storyline">
Trekking or exploring the Sahara dunes can be physically demanding, requiring stamina and endurance. Individuals with pre-existing medical conditions or limited physical fitness should consult a healthcare provider before embarking on such activities.
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  It is crucial to be prepared for these medical matters and take necessary precautions to ensure a safe and enjoyable visit to the Sahara dunes.
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">A reputable tour with knowledgable locals is essential</h3>
<p class="storyline">
 Some travel bloggers would recommend renting a jeep and doing the Sahara on your own. But honestly, this is not a responsible recommendation. There is no signal in most areas of the Sahara. It even gets to a point where there are no roads and you're just driving over sand dunes.   

</p>

<p class="storyline">
  Even someone from Marrakesh would have no idea where they are going out there. That's why we would definitely recommend visiting the Sahara with a tour group.
</p>


<h3 class="sub-head">Cultural etiquettes at Sahara dunes</h3>

<p class="storyline">
  There are a few key cultural etiquettes to keep in mind when visiting the Sahara dunes in Morocco. First, it is important to dress modestly, covering your shoulders and knees. Second, it is important to show respect for local customs and traditions. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  Third, be aware that bargaining is a part of the culture, so you may need to haggle when shopping in the souks. Finally, be respectful of the local people and try to learn some basic Arabic phrases to show your appreciation for the culture. 
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Language and communication at Sahara dunes</h3>

<p class="storyline">
  In terms of communication, most people in the Sahara dunes speak Arabic. However, French is also widely spoken, and many people also speak English. You may find that in smaller villages and towns, fewer people speak English, so it may be helpful to learn some basic Arabic phrases before you go. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  If you are traveling with a tour group, your guide will likely be able to translate for you. Additionally, most hotels and restaurants in the area will have someone who speaks English. 
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Safety at Sahara dunes</h3>

<p class="storyline">
  Safety is an important consideration when visiting the Sahara dunes in Morocco. While the area is generally safe, it is always important to exercise caution when traveling. It is a good idea to travel with a guide or in a group, and to be aware of your surroundings at all times. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  The sand can get extremely hot during the day, so it is important to wear appropriate shoes and clothing. There is also a risk of sandstorms, so it is important to stay up to date on the weather forecast. 
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Vital information on money matters</h3>

<p class="storyline">
  Money matters are an important consideration when traveling to the Sahara dunes in Morocco. The currency used in Morocco is the Moroccan dirham, and it is not possible to obtain it outside of the country. It is recommended to bring enough cash for your trip, as credit cards are not widely accepted. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  It is also important to be aware of the exchange rate, as it can fluctuate. There are a few ways to get cash while in Morocco, including ATMs and currency exchange offices. Additionally, it is a good idea to bring small bills, as change can be hard to come by. 
</p>
