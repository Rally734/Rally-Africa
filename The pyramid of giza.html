<div class="location">
  <h2 class="about">location: </h2> <h2 class="paragraph">Giza, Egypt</h2>
</div>
  <p class="story">
The Great pyramid of Giza is the largest Egyptian pyramid and served as the tomb of pharaoh Khufu, who ruled during the fourth dynasty of the old kingdom. Built in the early 26th century BC, over a period of about 27 years, the pyramid is the oldest of the seven Wonders of the world. 
</p>

<p class="storyline">
It is the most famous monument of the Giza pyramid complex,
which is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site "Memphis and its Necropolis". It is situated at the northern end of the line of the three pyramids at Giza. The pyramid rises to a height of 479ft(146m) with a base of 754ft(230m) and is comprised of over 2 million blocks of stone. 
</p>

<p class="storyline">Some of the stones are of such immense size and weight (such as the granite slabs in the King's Chamber) that the logistics of raising and
positioning them so precisely seems an impossibility by modern standards.

<h3 class="head">Things to know before travelling to The Great Pyramid of Giza. </h3>
<p class="story">
This article is a tip of the iceberg but will equip you with the "Absolute Need to Knows" for The Great Pyramid of Giza.</p>
<div id="sample">

  <h3 class="sub-head">How to get there?</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  To get to the Great Pyramid of Giza, you will need to travel to Giza, Egypt, which is located on the outskirts of Cairo. There are several ways to reach the pyramids:
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  You can fly into Cairo International Airport from major cities around the world. From the airport, you can take a taxi or arrange for a private transfer to Giza. Once you are in Cairo, you can take a taxi or ride-sharing service to Giza. It is recommended to negotiate the fare before getting into the taxi.
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  You can also take a bus or the Cairo Metro to Giza. From there, you can take a taxi or walk to the pyramids.There are many  tour companies that offer guided tours to the pyramids, which often include transportation from Cairo to Giza.
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  Once you are in Giza, you can easily access the Great Pyramid of Giza and other nearby pyramids by following the signs or hiring a guide.
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">About the weather</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  The weather at the Great Pyramid of Giza is quite hot and dry. The summers are long and very hot, with temperatures reaching over 100 degrees Fahrenheit. The winters are short and warm, with temperatures averaging in the 70s and 80s. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  And while it's always sunny, the evenings can be chilly, so it's important to bring a jacket. And finally, it's important to stay hydrated when visiting the pyramids, as the dry heat can be quite taxing. 
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Medical matters that affect your visit</h3>
<h3 class="topic">
  Dehydration
</h3>
<p class="storyline">
Visiting the Great Pyramid of Giza can involve a lot of physical activity and exposure to the sun. It is important to stay hydrated to prevent dehydration, which can lead to symptoms like dizziness, fatigue, and confusion.
</p>
<h3 class="topic">
  Heat stroke
</h3>
<p class="storyline">
The desert climate around the Great Pyramid can be very hot, especially during the summer months. This can increase the risk of heat stroke, a serious condition that requires immediate medical attention. Symptoms include a high body temperature, rapid pulse, and possible loss of consciousness.
</p>
<h3 class="topic">
  Sunburn
</h3>
<p class="storyline">
Excessive sun exposure can result in sunburn, which can be painful and uncomfortable. Severe sunburns may require medical treatment to manage symptoms like blistering and skin peeling.
</p>
<h3 class="topic">
  Respiratory issues
</h3>
<p class="storyline">
The dusty and dry environment around the pyramid can trigger respiratory issues in some people, especially those with pre-existing respiratory conditions like asthma or allergies. It is important to have necessary medications on hand in case of an exacerbation.
</p>
<h3 class="topic">
  Musculoskeletal injuries
</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  Climbing or exploring the pyramid can involve physical exertion and navigating uneven terrain. There is a risk of slips, trips, or falls leading to musculoskeletal injuries like sprains, strains, or fractures.
</p>
<h3 class="topic">
  Travel-related illnesses
</h3>
<p class="storyline">
Traveling to Egypt may expose you to different pathogens and environments, increasing the risk of travel-related illnesses such as traveler's diarrhea, insect bites, or exposure to infectious diseases endemic to the area.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
  In the event of a medical emergency or if you experience any concerning symptoms during your visit to the Great Pyramid of Giza, it is important to seek immediate medical attention and follow local medical protocols. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  It's also advisable to travel with a basic first aid kit, stay informed about health advisories in the region, and take necessary precautions to safeguard your health during your visit.
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">The pyramids aren't always open.</h3>
<p class="storyline">
The pyramids have operating times. The usual schedule runs from 8.am to 5.pm. Although it might be neat to see the pyramids at night, it makes sense to close down the site at certain times of the day.  
</p>
<p class="storyline">
   There are also other times when the pyramid will be closed. For example, during the winter, the pyramids close half an hour early, at 4:30.pm. During the festival of Ramadan, they close even earlier, at 3.pm. Pyramid sites may be closed for restoration at any point, so be sure to check when it's open and when it's not before you head out.    
</p>



<h3 class="sub-head">You don't need a camel to get there</h3>
<p class="storyline">
 You don't need to book a camel or horse ride around the site, although some guides and vendors will try to convince you to do so. Most often, tourists are told there's a 5-mile walk from the taxi stand where they arrive to the pyramids and the Sphinx statue.   
</p>

<p class="storyline">
This isn't true, and the pyramids are easily accessible. It's more like a 5-minute walk from the taxi stand. If you want to book a camel ride, be sure to do so from your hotel as part of your package, or head down to the stables to negotiate the best price.
</p>
<p class="storyline">

</p>



<h3 class="sub-head">You may need to haggle</h3>

<p class="storyline">
  In some cultures, haggling is a way of life. At the pyramids of Giza, it's pretty much expected that you'll haggle with the vendors setting up shop around the site.         
</p>

<p class="storyline">
 Most vendors sell overpriced souvenirs here since they know people will pay additional markup. If you see something you like, be sure to haggle with the vendor. If you don't want anything or prefer not to be bothered, give a polite but firm "no, thank you."         
</p>

<p class="storyline">
   Do be aware the vendors here have a reputation as being quite persistent, so be prepared to stand your ground. You need to buy anything if you don't want to.      
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">You shouldn't climb them (But some people try anyway)</h3>


<p class="storyline">
It should go without saying that, after thousands of years of withering desert sun and shifting sands, the pyramids are, well, a little fragile. While they're still standing and unlikely to crumble away to dust in our lifetimes, most peeople agree we should treat the pyramids with some respect.     
</p>

<p class="storyline">
      In accordance with this new outlook, climbing the structures was banned in the late 1980s, in an effort to limit damage to both the site itself and to unwitting tourists who happened to hurt themselves. However, some people still try to scale the pyramids to get a better vintage point. Doing so can get you in trouble, unless you've been handpicked by a guard to climb up a little higher.        
</p>



<h3 class="sub-head">Bring some water</h3>
<p class="storyline">
 Most people have seen pictures of the Giza complex. If you have, you likely know the pyramids are basically surrounded by the open deserts on three sides. Although Giza is creeping closer, it doesn't change the fact that this wonder of the world is still in the middle of a desert.
</p>

<p class="storyline">
As a result, the climate is often hot and dry. In the summer months, the temperature can push 30 degree Celsius, and the desert sands make it feel even warmer. You'll want to bring some water with you, especially if you don't want to pay for overpriced bottles on site. Sunscreen and a hat are highly recommended.    
</p>



<h3 class="sub-head">There are other tombs in Egypt</h3>

<p class="storyline">
The pyramids of Giza are perhaps the best known examples of ancient Egyptian architecture, but they are certainly not the only thing these ancient people built. In fact, you can visit any number of other sites around Egypt.

</p>

<p class="storyline">
Some popular choices include Luxor, on the site of ancient Thebes. Here, you'll find Luxor Temple and Karnak Temple. Just across the river are the tombs of the valley of the Kings and the Valley of the queens. There's even a sphinx here too!
</p>

<p class="storyline">
    If you truly want to learn more about ancient Egypt, the pyramids of Giza are a great place to start, but there's more to see.     
</p>



<h3 class="sub-head">Tipping is expected</h3>

<p class="storyline">
 This next tip is one that will serve you well anywhere in Egypt. You're going to want to carry plenty of small bills and coins with you, since you'll need to tip for almost any "service" provided to you. In fact, you may even need to "tip" to get toilet paper in the bathroom.        
</p>

<p class="storyline">
  Tips, called "baksheesh," are expected for everything from an Uber or taxi ride, to services such as having a phone repaired. Almost anyone who starts a conversation with you will likely be looking to offer you a service so they can request a tip. This can become quite annoying, so it's best to be prepared when visiting a major site like the pyramids.      
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head"> Cultural etiquettes at the great pyramid of Giza</h3>

<p class="storyline">
  When visiting the Great Pyramid of Giza, it's important to be respectful of the local culture and customs. First, dress modestly, as revealing clothing is not appropriate in Egypt. It's also important to remove your shoes before entering any of the pyramids. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  Additionally, avoid pointing or touching the ancient relics, as this can damage them. And finally, be respectful when taking photos, as some areas are considered sacred and photography is not allowed.  
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  By following these simple guidelines, you can ensure that you have a safe and respectful visit to the Great Pyramid of Giza.
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Language and communication at The Great Pyramid of Giza</h3>

<p class="storyline">
  The most common language spoken at the Great Pyramid of Giza is Arabic. However, many people also speak English, as it's the most widely spoken foreign language in Egypt. If you don't speak Arabic or English, it's a good idea to bring a phrasebook or dictionary, or to download a translation app on your phone. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  Additionally, be aware that the use of hand gestures is very common in Egypt, so it's important to be aware of the meaning behind different gestures. For example, pointing is considered very rude in Egyptian culture. 
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Vital information on money matters</h3>

<p class="storyline">
  There are a few important things to know about money matters when visiting the Great Pyramid of Giza. First, it's best to carry some Egyptian pounds in cash, as many places do not accept credit cards. It's also a good idea to have small bills, as many vendors do not have change for large bills. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  Additionally, be aware that many vendors will try to overcharge tourists, so it's important to haggle and be prepared to walk away if the price is too high. And finally, be aware of counterfeit money, as it's not uncommon in Egypt. 
</p>
