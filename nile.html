<p class="story">
  The River Nile is one of the most famous and historically significant rivers in the world. It flows for over 4,000 miles, from it's source in the mountains of Burundi to its mouth in the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile flows through 11 countries, including Egypt, Sudan, and Ethiopia. But it's most closely associated with Egypt, where it has played a crucial role in the country's history and culture.
  <p class="storyline">
  The River Nile is the longest river in Africa, and it's one of the oldest inhabited areas in the world. The ancient Egyptians built their civilization around the Nile and depended on it for food, transportation and irrigation. One of the most amazing things about the Nile is its annual flooding cycle. For thousands of years, the river would flood every summer, depositing rich silt that allowed the ancient 
  Egyptians to grow crops in the desert. 
</p>
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  Even today, the flooding of the Nile has a huge impact on Egyptian life. It's a fascinating example of how humans have adapted to the natural world around them. And it's just one of the many reasons why the Nile is such a special and important river.

The winters (November to March) are cooler, with temperatures ranging from 60 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (15 to 27 degrees Celsius). Rain is rare, but the humidity can be high, especially in the summer. 
</p>


<h3 class="sub-head">Medical matters that affect your visit.</h3>

<h3 class="topic">Heat illness</h3>

<p class="storyline">
  The high temperatures in Egypt can lead to heat exhaustion and heat stroke, so it's important to stay hydrated and take breaks in the shade. Wear light-colored, loose-fitting clothing, and a hat to help keep cool. And if you're feeling unwell, seek medical attention immediately.

</p>

<h3 class="topic">Sun protection</h3>

<p class="storyline">
  The sun in Egypt is very strong, so be sure to use sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher. A hat and sunglasses are also recommended. And also remember to stay out of the sun during the hottest part of the day, from 11.am to 3.pm.

<h3 class="sub-head">Language and Dress code for visiting the Nile River</h3>

<p class="storyline">
  The official language of Egypt is Arabic, but English is widely spoken in tourist areas. However, learning a few basic Arabic phrases is a great way to show respect and appreciation for the culture. Some useful phrases to know include: "hello" (ahlan), "please"(min fadlak), "thank you"(shukran), and "goodbye"(ma'a salama). 
</p>

<p class="storyline">
In terms of dress code, Egypt is a conservative country, so it's important to dress modestly, especially when visiting religious sites. For women, this means covering your shoulders and knees, and wearing long skirts or dresses or long pants.  
</p>

<p class="storyline">
  For men, shorts are generally not appropriate, and it's best to wear long pants and shirts with sleeves. It's also a good idea to wear comfortable shoes, as you'll likely be doing a lot of working. And in the hot summer months, it's important to stay cool and hydrated by wearing light, breathable clothing.  
</p>

<p class="storyline">
  Overall, it's best to err on the side of modesty and avoid revealing clothing. By dressing respectively, you'll be sure to have a positive experience while visiting the Nile River. And remember, regardless of your dress, always be respectful and courteous when visiting Egypt.
</p>


<h3 class="sub-head">Safety at Nile River</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  The Nile River in Egypt is generally considered to be a safe destination for visitors, although there are a few safety precautions that should be taken into consideration. First, it is important to be aware of the strong currents and undertows in the river, so it is best to swim only in designated areas and under the supervision of a lifeguard. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  Additionally, it is important to be mindful of the local laws and regulations, as there have been reports of arrests and fines for violating them. Finally, there have been reports of petty crime and pickpocketing in the area, so it is best to keep an eye on belongings and to travel in groups when possible. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  It is also important to be aware of the political and social unrest that has been occurring in Egypt in recent years. Although the Nile River is generally a safe place to visit, it is always best to stay informed and to follow the advice of local authorities.
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Vital information on money matters.</h3>

</p>

<h3 class="topic">Tipping</h3>

<p class="storyline">
  Tipping is customary in Egypt, and it's often expected in restaurants, hotels and taxis. A good rule of thumb is to tip 10% to 15% of the total bill.

</p>

<h3 class="topic">Credit cards</h3>

<p class="storyline">
  Most major credit cards are accepted in Egypt, including Visa, Mastercard and American Express. However, some smaller businesses may only accept cash, so it's a good idea to have some cash on hand.
