  </p>
  <p class="storyline">
          As you climb higher, the temperatures drop, and at the summit, the temperature can drop below freezing. There is also a rainy season from March to May, when rainfall is common. The dry season is from June to October, when the weather is typically sunny and clear.    
</p>

</p>
 

<h3 class="topic"> Sun burn</h3>
<p class="storyline">
          The altitude and sun exposure on Mount Kilimanjaro can increase your risk of sunburn. Make sure to wear sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, and reapply it frequently.

                    This is a condition that can occur when you ascend too quickly to high altitudes. Symptoms include headache, dizziness, nausea, and shortness of breath. It's important to recognize the symptoms of AMS and descend to lower altitudes if they occur.
