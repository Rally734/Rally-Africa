<p class="story">
          Gondar city is home to the Fasil Ghebbi, a UNESCO World Heritage Site that includes the ruins of many old castles and palaces. Gondar was the capital of Ethiopia from 1632 to 1855, and during that time it was known as the "City of Castles".     
  </p>

  <p class="storyline">
          These include Fasilides Castle, the former royal palace of Emperor Fasilides; Ghebbi Baths, where the emperors used to bathe; and Qusquam, the oldest church in Gondar. Other notable landmarks include Debre Berhan Selassie, a church famous for its intricate murals, and the Bath of Timket, where the Ethiopian Orthodox Epiphany festival is held every year.     
  <p class="storyline">
          One of the most interesting things about Gondar is its mix of Ethiopian and European architectural styles. Many of the castles and palaces were built in the Baroque style, which was popular in Europe during the 17th century.      
    
        </p>
        <p class="storyline">

          </p>
          <p class="storyline">    
          And, with its rich history and culture, it's no wonder that it's one of Ethiopia's most popular tourist destinations.
