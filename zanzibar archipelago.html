<h3 class="head">Things to know before travelling to Zanzibar Archipelago</h3>
<p class="story">
This article is a tip of the iceberg but will equip you with the "Absolute Need to Knows" for Zanzibar archipelago.</p>
<div id="sample">
<h3 class="sub-head">How to get there?</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  To get to the Zanzibar Archipelago in Tanzania, you can typically fly into Abeid Amani Karume International Airport, also known as Zanzibar International Airport, which is located on Unguja Island, the main island of the archipelago. 
  </p>
  <p class="storyline">
  There are direct flights to Zanzibar from major cities in East Africa such as Nairobi, Dar es Salaam, and Addis Ababa, as well as international flights from destinations in Europe and the Middle East.   
  </p>
  <p class="storyline">
    Once you arrive at Zanzibar International Airport, you can take a taxi, shuttle, or private transfer to your accommodation or desired destination on Unguja Island. If you are traveling to one of the other islands in the archipelago, such as Pemba Island, you can take a domestic flight, ferry, or speedboat from Unguja Island.     
</p>


<h3 class="sub-head">About the weather</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  The weather in the Zanzibar Archipelago is warm and tropical year-round. The average temperature ranges from the high 70s to the mid-80s Fahrenheit.

  </p>
  <p class="storyline">
    The islands experience two main seasons: the dry season and the wet season. The dry season usually occurs from June to October, with little to no rainfall and lower humidity levels. The wet season, from November to May, sees more rainfall, particularly in the form of short, heavy downpours. However, even during the rainy season, there are still plenty of sunny days and warm temperatures.     
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  The archipelago is also affected by the Indian Ocean monsoon winds, which bring rain and humidity during the wet season. Overall, Zanzibar's weather is characterized by warm temperatures, plenty of sunshine, and occasional showers.
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Medical matters that affect your visit.</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  When visiting the Zanzibar archipelago in Tanzania, there are several medical considerations to keep in mind to ensure a safe and healthy trip. Some medical matters that may affect your visit to Zanzibar include:
</p>
<h3 class="topic">Vaccinations</h3>

<p class="storyline">
  It is recommended to be up-to-date on routine vaccinations such as measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccine, varicella (chickenpox) vaccine, polio vaccine, and a yearly flu shot. Additionally, vaccinations for hepatitis A, typhoid, and yellow fever may be needed depending on your specific travel plans and medical history.  
  </p>

 

<h3 class="topic">  Malaria</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  Malaria is a concern in Zanzibar, so it is important to take appropriate antimalarial medication before, during, and after your trip. It is also crucial to take preventive measures such as using insect repellent, sleeping under mosquito nets, and wearing long sleeves and pants to avoid mosquito bites.     
  </p>

  <h3 class="topic">  Travelers Diarrhea</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  Like in many travel destinations, the risk of traveler's diarrhea is present in Zanzibar. To reduce the risk, make sure to drink only bottled or purified water, avoid consuming raw or undercooked food, and practice good hygiene such as washing hands frequently.         
  </p>

  <h3 class="topic"> Sun Protection</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  Zanzibar is a tropical destination with strong sunlight, so it is important to protect yourself from sunburns and heat-related illnesses. Remember to use sunscreen with a high SPF, wear sun-protective clothing, stay hydrated, and seek shade during peak sun hours.     
  </p>

  <h3 class="topic"> Water-borne Diseases </h3>
  <p class="storyline">
    Contaminated water is a common source of gastrointestinal infections in Zanzibar. To prevent waterborne illnesses, avoid drinking untreated water, including tap water, and opt for bottled water or water that has been boiled or treated.      
    </p>
    <h3 class="topic"> Heat-related Illnesses</h3>
    <p class="storyline">
      The heat and humidity in Zanzibar can lead to heat exhaustion or heatstroke, especially if you are not acclimated to such weather conditions. Stay hydrated, avoid prolonged exposure to direct sunlight, and seek shade or air-conditioned spaces when needed.        
      </p>
<p class="storyline">
  These are some of the key medical matters to consider when planning a visit to the Zanzibar archipelago. It is essential to consult with a healthcare provider or travel medicine specialist well in advance of your trip to get personalized recommendations based on your health status and travel itinerary.

<h3 class="sub-head">Cultural Etiquettes at Zanzibar Archipelago</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  Zanzibar  has a rich cultural heritage influenced by Arab, Persian, Indian, and African traditions. When visiting Zanzibar, it is important to be aware of and respect the local cultural etiquettes. Here are some key cultural etiquettes to keep in mind:  
</p>

<p class="storyline">
  Greetings are very important in Zanzibari culture. When meeting someone, it is customary to say "Jambo" (hello) or "Habari" (how are you?), followed by "nzuri" (fine) or "salama" (safe) in response. Handshakes are common, especially between men, but be aware that some women may prefer not to shake hands with men. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  Zanzibar is a predominantly Muslim community, so it is important to dress modestly, especially when visiting mosques or rural areas. Women should cover their shoulders and knees, and men should avoid wearing shorts in public places. 
  </p>
  <p class="storyline">
  Elders are highly respected in Zanzibar. It is important to show respect to elders by greeting them first, using respectful language, and listening attentively when they speak.
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  When invited to someone's home for a meal, it is polite to wash your hands before and after eating. It is also common to eat with your right hand, as the left hand is considered unclean.
  </p>
  <p class="storyline">
  Public displays of affection are considered inappropriate in Zanzibar, so it is best to refrain from kissing or hugging in public.
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  When visiting mosques or other religious sites, remember to dress modestly and remove your shoes before entering. Women should cover their heads with a scarf. 
  </p>
  <p class="storyline"> 
  Always ask for permission before taking photos of people, especially in rural areas, as some may believe that photographs can capture their soul. Finally, Be mindful of local customs and traditions, and be open to learning about and experiencing the local way of life.
</p>
<p class="storyline"> 
  By observing these cultural etiquettes, you can show respect for the local customs and traditions of the people of the Zanzibar archipelago and make your visit a more enriching and enjoyable experience.
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Language and communication at Zanzibar Archipelago</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  The official language of the Zanzibar Archipelago is Swahili, but many people on the islands also speak English. English is widely used in hotels, restaurants, and other tourist areas. In more remote areas, however, Swahili may be the only language spoken.     
</p>

<p class="storyline">
  If you're planning on visiting the Zanzibar Archipelago, it's a good idea to learn some basic Swahili phrases, such as "Jambo" (hello), "Hakuna matata" (no worries), and "Asante" (thank you). Even if you don't speak the language fluently, a few basic phrases can go a long way in showing respect and making a connection with the local people.    
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  Body language is also an important part of communication in the Zanzibar Archipelago. It's common to nod your head and make eye contact when speaking to someone. And be sure to avoid pointing, as it's considered rude. 
</p>


<h3 class="sub-head">Safety Precautions at Zanzibar Archipelago</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  The Zanzibar Archipelago is generally considered to be a safe place to visit, but as with any travel destination, it's important to exercise caution and use common sense. 
</p>
<p class="storyline">
  Violent crime is rare, but petty theft and pickpocketing can be a problem, especially in tourist areas. It's best to keep your belongings close to you at all times, and don't leave your valuables unattended. 
</p>

<h3 class="sub-head">Vital Information On Money Matters</h3>

<p class="storyline">
  When it comes to money matters in the Zanzibar Archipelago, the local currency is the Tanzanian shilling (TZS). The US dollar is also widely accepted, especially in hotels and tourist areas. There are ATMs available on Zanzibar Island and in Pemba Island, but they are not always reliable, so it's a good idea to bring enough cash to cover your expenses.     
  </p>

  <p class="storyline">
    Most major credit cards are accepted in hotels and some restaurants, but smaller businesses may only accept cash. When getting cash, be sure to check the currency conversion rate and exchange rate before you go.      
  </p>
  <p class="storyline">
    Another important thing to know about money matters in the Zanzibar Archipelago is that bargaining is common, especially at markets and small businesses. It's part of the culture to negotiate prices, so don't be afraid to haggle a bit. However, be respectful and don't try to haggle too aggressively. 
  </p>
  <p class="storyline">
    Bargaining should be done in a friendly and polite manner. Tipping is not mandatory, but it's always appreciated, especially for guides and drivers. A 10-15% tip is customary. And be sure to have small bills on hand, as change can be difficult to come by. 
  </p>
  <p class="storyline">
    You can now enjoy your time in this beautiful and unique destination without worrying about money-related issues. Just remember to stay safe, be respectful, and have fun!
