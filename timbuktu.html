</div>

<p class="story">
     Timbuktu was founded around the year 1100, and it quickly became an important center of Islamic learning. The city was a hub for scholars from all over Africa and the Middle East, and its manuscripts covered a wide range of topics, from law and science to literature and poetry. 
     </p>
     <p class="storyline">
     By the 15th century, Timbuktu was one of the wealthiest cities in Africa, and it was a major trading center for gold, salt, and other goods. It was also home to a number of skilled artisans who produced beautiful textiles, jewelry, and other items.       
  </p>

  <p class="storyline">
    The largest of these manuscript libraries is the Ahmed Baba Institute, which houses over 40,000 manuscripts that were collected from private homes and mosques all over the region. These manuscripts are written in a variety of languages, including Arabic, Berber, and local African languages.      
  <p class="storyline">
    They cover a wide range of topics, including astronomy, mathematics, medicine, and history. In addition to the Ahmed Baba Institute, there are a number of smaller libraries in Timbuktu that also contain valuable manuscripts.       
    
        </p>
        <p class="storyline">
          Another interesting aspect of Timbuktu's history is its role in the trans-Saharan trade network. For centuries, caravans of camels would travel from Timbuktu to North Africa and beyond, carrying goods such as gold, salt, and ivory.  
          </p>
          <p class="storyline">    
            This trade brought wealth and prosperity to the city, and it also helped to spread Islamic culture and ideas throughout the region. Many of the mosques and shrines within Timbuktu were built using the wealth that came from this trade.    
          </p>

<h3 class="sub-head">How to get there?</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  Getting to Timbuktu is not easy, but it's certainly possible! The most common way to get there is to fly into Bamako, Mali, which is the country's capital. From there, you can take a bus or hire a car to take you the rest of the way to Timbuktu.

</p>


<h3 class="sub-head">About the weather</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  Timbuktu has a desert climate, with very hot and dry weather throughout most of the year. The hottest months are April and May, when temperatures can reach up to 110 degrees Fahrenheit. During the rainy season, from July to September, the temperatures are a bit cooler, but the humidity is high.  
          </p>
          <p class="storyline">
            Even during the cooler months, from November to February, the temperatures are still quite warm, ranging from 75 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Overall, Timbuktu is a hot and dry place, so be prepared for the heat if you're planning a visit!

          </p>

<h3 class="topic">Malaria</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  Timbuktu, like many regions in Mali, is at risk of malaria. It is essential to take preventive measures such as taking antimalarial medication, wearing protective clothing, and using insect repellents. Additionally, consider sleeping under mosquito nets and staying in accommodations with proper screens or air-conditioning.         
</p>

<h3 class="topic">Food and Water Safety</h3>

<p class="storyline">
  In Timbuktu, as in other developing areas, it is important to pay attention to food and water hygiene. Drink only bottled water or water that has been boiled and avoid consuming raw or undercooked food. Wash your hands frequently and carry hand sanitizer for situations where clean water is unavailable. 
  </p>

<h3 class="topic">Heat and Sun exposure</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  Timbuktu experiences extremely high temperatures, especially during the summer months. Protect yourself from heatstroke and sunburn by wearing lightweight, loose-fitting clothing, using sunscreen with a high SPF, and drinking plenty of fluids. Seek shade during the hottest times of the day
          </p>
        
  <h3 class="topic">Traveler's Diarrhea</h3>
<p class="storyline">
  Like in many travel destinations, the risk of traveler's diarrhea exists in Timbuktu.

          <p class="storyline">
